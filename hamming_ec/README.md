# Hamming Erasure Coding
Library for employing Hamming codes for erasure coding.

## Theory
Since each data bit in a Hamming code is covered by a unique pattern of parity bits, it should be possible to restore missing bits.  Since hamming codes allow for detecting two bit errors, when used as an erasure code it should allow for recovering up to two missing blocks.
